      <h2>My Early Years</h2>
      <img src="imgs/img 2.jpg" alt="Baby photo" style="max-width:200px;">
      <p>
        I was born on 18th May,2003 in Nairobi, Kenya. 
        As a child, I was happy and precocious, with a strong interest in justice and technology. Spending time on NATGeo learning awesome facts about nature and wildlife. The interest grew so much that i aspired to be a Game Ranger. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended many schools and learned so much. Having been raised by a community, we shared many experiences.

      <p>
        Having started school in Nairobi and later moving to a boarding school in Kiambu county, i felt the change. New school and new challenges to face. I tried all i could to thrive and i did. I joined as many clubs and got into leadership positions. I was also able to form very strong friendships and reading groups to push eah other to excellence. 
        The neighbourhood wasn't the perfect but we managed in our own ways with many dangers erupting and bringing about inseurity. I was still able to survive through the help of my family as they tried to push me to try football and other forms of engagements through church camps and retreats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I attended Light Academy after completing my primary eduation. This was another major change in lifestyle and environment.
       I was still short and wimpy unlike my classmates who seemed to have gone through puberty with beards and broadened chests.
        Even as the odd one out, i still tries to fit in engaging in sporting activities. I was majorly drawn to rugby and was able to join the school team. My small physique forced a smile in many but my style of play left many in amazement.  
        Eventually I completed my secondary education, where I graduated with a good B Minus grade.

        In my senior years, I joined Riara University, where I pursued a diploma in International Relations and Dilpomacy. It was one of the most interesting times of my life because I got to meet new people and learn new things.

        I was also involved in various extracurricular activities, including the Mental Health Foundation Australia campaigns and events.
